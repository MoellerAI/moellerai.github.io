**Machine Learning series:** This machine learning series of articles aims to teach about various machine learning algorithms. The papers describes the mathematics behind the algorithms and with the help of mathematics we are going to understand and implement machine learning algorithms in Python. This series is sequential, so start with the first article about *Linear Regression*.

**Prerequisites:**  

The mathematics in machine learning mostly rely on linear algebra and probability theory. Therefore, it is highly recommended to have some basic knowledge on these topics before trying to understand the different machine learning algorithms. The programming language used in this series is Python it is recommended to be familiar with basic Python programming.
